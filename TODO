Get a index
scripts
styles

run some webserver to see stuff.

Make a todo list webpage


Much later: save to localstorage?

* some styleing (css grid or flexbox?)
* add second imput for due date
* add dynamic styling (late = red)

Notice two ways to write it, html, and js function sucks
make everything js function, talk about template languages

now make a template function
Takes in arguments

That means we need to store json to represent the list,
and then run the template.  Make the initial items generated by js.


add a checkbox





Also later: make chat app, as it's a google product.
